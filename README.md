# PasswordGenerator

![Password Generator](images/password-generator.png)

This repository contains code snippets for generating secure and random passwords in Java. The code examples provided will help you generate strong passwords for your Java applications and systems.

## Introduction

Creating strong passwords is crucial for ensuring the security of online accounts and sensitive data. Weak passwords are susceptible to hacking attempts, and to mitigate this risk, using a password generator is highly recommended.

## Code Snippet

### Java

```java
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class PasswordGenerator {
    public static String generatePassword(int length) {
        String characters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()_-+=";
        StringBuilder password = new StringBuilder(length);
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();

        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            int randomIndex = random.nextInt(characters.length());
            password.append(characters.charAt(randomIndex));
        }

        return password.toString();
    }
}
```
# How to Use

1. Copy the provided `PasswordGenerator` class into your Java project.
2. Call the `generatePassword` method with the desired password length as an argument.
3. The method will return a random and secure password.

**Remember to store generated passwords securely and avoid hardcoding them in your code or committing them to version control systems.**

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Java password generator:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int passwordLength = 16;
        String generatedPassword = PasswordGenerator.generatePassword(passwordLength);
        System.out.println(generatedPassword);
    }
}
```
